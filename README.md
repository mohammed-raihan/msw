This paper proposes using incineration to recover energy from municipal solid waste to produce electricity in the urban areas of Dhaka and Chattogram. 
A detailed technical analysis involving energy, exergy, exergoeconomic, and emission is presented. 
The power plants in these two cities show potential capacities of 169 MW and 83 MW respectively, with exergoeconomic factors of 61 %. 
The results indicate energy and exergy efficiencies of 32 % and 27 %, respectively, and a production cost in the range of 53.9â€“56.7 USD/MWh 
which is comparable to the production cost from the current power plants in Bangladesh. 
The proposed plants also result in a reduction in the greenhouse emissions and exhibit ecological efficiencies of over 87 %.
